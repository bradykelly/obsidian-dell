# Trust

## I am not trusted!

**2024-01-27** There is very little that I hate more than not being trusted, being used , and being lied to. There must be some extenuating circumstance that has caused my friends to turn on me, and so far I blame the police. I can see at least Shaun is probably a nice person at heart, and I know I have seen Sue behaving naturally and she seems a truly beautiful person.

She just called me and asked me about charging a vape battery. I know how battery chargers work, and because I still view her as a friend, I agreed and set about finding gadgets I could convert to charge the common Vuse vape cell. While doing so, I overheard more than just whispers about the "Brady problem" yet again. 

# Why am I such a fucking problem??? Just who has convinced Sue that I cannot be trusted, and with what bullshit reasoning?

## Who is misleading Sue?

This nasty turn of events started after Sue's arrest. She doesn't trust Trevor or Gavin, so that leaves only the two Shauns. I have heard Sue telling Shaun McDonald not to trust me, so I must suspect Shaun Hancock. She trusts him a lot more than I do, and of course a lot more than me. All it would have taken would be a few small hints from him, because he fucking knows everything.

What could Hancock's motive be to sabotage whatever friendship may have existed between me and Sue? Has he made me a suspect in her setup and arrest? He has spent far too much time making busywork so as to be moving himself and fuck knows what else around this house for me to trust him. He has been overly nice, overly helpful, and overly observing. And half of what he has helped with or said he would has either failed or not materialized.

What on this fucking ball of rock could have motivated Shaun McDonald to be the one to cause this? I am fucking light years away from his arrest and case and always have been. And just how much risk will he put himself in for this desperate woman?
