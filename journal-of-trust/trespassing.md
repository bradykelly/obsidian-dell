**2024-01-26** Today it seemed very much like the two "friends" wanted to alone determine what I drank. A very obvious effort was made to pour all my drinks for me. Even the one I poured myself and drank was then topped up by one of the two, and later a very determined effort was made to prevent me from drinking water from a bottle that had been "lovingly" handed to me earlier that day as normal drinking water.

That was followed by an attempt to enter my bedroom unannounced. I could hear Sue over and over telling Sean to "go", when they thought I was in the bathroom with the door closed, and I might have heard someone start to open my door, but I made a loud noise. Why enter my room when I'm not present? Perhaps to plant something? Plant what? Another bug, drugs, something else incriminating? There sure isn't much to steal.

# Fucking Why???
