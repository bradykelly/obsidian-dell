**2024-01-27** It now seems my friends still suspect me of something, probably something to do with Sue's arrest, or something equally heinous. I am getting the silent treatment, and looks.

**I cannot stand it when someone has an issue with me and won't confront me with it**. I can't raise it because for some fucking reason they still believe their stale old, and stupid, denial is still effective. I wonder if they keep using it because they think or know our conversations are monitored; they really cannot be stupid enough to really believe it is at all effective with me. 

Yes, it might stand up as evidence, because I am supposed to have had a psychotic episode according to them, and I am indeed very anxious, but my anxiety is born of being mistrusted by people that seemed very like friends before Sue's arrest, and spoken about in what they seem to think is secret. 

My suspicion that my PC (or maybe even more than 1) has been compromised and the inexplicable technical difficulties I experience extremely frequently, often more than once an hour, that delay my work of completing profile projects and finalizing my online CV. This means we are all at risk of being evicted when I cannot pay anything towards rent. 

I hope I'm wrong when I worry that they are simply planning on leaving without notice, despite all the work Sue has put into making this her home. I simply cannot believe that was all pretense - she really worked very hard at improving our living space.

I can understand Sue not trusting me, and I have overheard snippets of "secret" conversations where I think I have heard her giving Shaun reasons to not trust me. She has only known me just over four years. Now Shaun and I have known each other, not actually been friends, for somewhere around twenty years. I believed that with more frequent visits over the last few years, with long conversations where I have really opened up about myself and my history, that we had actually become friends.

It really hurts me a lot that after knowing me as long as he has, and more recently, pretending to be a friend, that he so easily accepts what can only be ridiculous assertions by Sue about my character and behavior. Never in all the years we have known each other has my reputation suffered any setbacks except for being a drunk, and excessive drug use very long ago. 

I have never had any encounters with the law, I have never snitched on anybody, not even in my drunken years, let alone on him or Sue, as we regularly share the same activities that our law considers offences, such as drug use. Minor drug use, with small quantities used in casual social circumstances.

A few months ago a parcel being couriered by Courier Guy, containing illegally purchased prescription medications, was seized by SAPS according to Courier Guy. The next, similar parcel was again allegedly seized by SAPS, and every day I wonder why the SAPS did not even contact me, let alone charge me. It adds to my hurt that this may be a reason they suspect me of whatever their very wild imaginations have decided on. Even worse is that Shaun, despite only superficially knowing me most of the time since we met, has never heard anything about me not being trustworthy. If he has, it is from a very confused liar or someone that knows nothing about me.

Now they construe my paranoia, and my dislike of being watched and listened to covertly, as something funny about me. **It is fucking as natural as gravity to be upset at being deprived of all privacy in your own home!** 

I cannot understand why, unless she has a personal agenda, that Sue so readily grabs at any differences in my behaviour from a very average person, one without any unique personality traits. I am sorry for being unique, Sue! 

I have never given her any reason, except trying to avoid their surveillance, to mistrust me. I was one of Shaun's few friends that almost instantly accepted her as a trusted friend, despite her background, history, and work. The hurt I feel is very much worse because she could not do the same for me, or did so and then believed something idiotic someone unknown to me told her about me.
