# JSON Resume Resources

## [Registry Functions](https://github.com/jsonresume/registry-functions)
 - This repository is responsible for our free community hosting. It currently runs on Firebase.

## [Customized Registry Functions](https://github.com/anthonyjdella/customized-registry-functions/blob/master/README.md)
- This is a slightly tweaked version of the [JSON Registry](https://github.com/jsonresume/registry-functions). That project is using their own Firebase project and a specific JSON schema. Since I customized my own schema, I want to be able to use this with a registry so that my schema is validated.

## [JSONResume Export](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jsonresume-export)
- GitHub action
- This action exports your resume in [JSONResume](https://jsonresume.org/) to **HTML**. This can be combined with other actions to publish your resume as a Github page.

## [ng-jsonresume](https://github.com/marko-knoebl/ng-jsonresume)
- ng-jsonresume lets you include a resume into a webpage by using an Angular directive and providing data in the standardized jsonresume format.

- It provides a custom HTML tag that can be used like this:

- `<resume resume-url="myresume.json" template-url="resume-template-flat.html"></resume>`
