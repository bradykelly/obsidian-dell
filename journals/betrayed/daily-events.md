- Today it seemed very much like the two "friends" wanted to determine what I drank. A very obvious effort was made to pour all my drinks for me. Even the one I poured myself and drank was then topped up by one of the two.

Sue seems determined to compromise our security and privacy.

That was followed by an attempt to enter my bedroom unnanounced. I could hear Sue over and over telling SEan to "go", when they thought I was in the bathroom. Why enter my room when I'm not present? Perhaps to plant something?
