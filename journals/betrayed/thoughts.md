# The Housemates

## Part 1 - Betrayal

They found it a big joke on me, stupid enough to think I would believe all the whispering, mentions of my name, and even fucking laughter, to be hallucinations. Just how fucking stupid do you have to be?

How stupid do you have to be to not be discrete with your whispering, to be overt enough I could follow conversations from the other side of the house. We've have fucking silent electronic comms available everywhere around us for decades. Even a fucking imbecile would have used Whatsapp or Messenger for secret conversations.

But why? We had a good friendship, I thought, at least with Shaun, and Sue is truly such a wonderful, bright, sexy light and genuinely a good person. Who or what cancelled me from the friendship, and since this started, I have more than once asked them "Why", only to have my question ignored.

I am angry, hurt, and insulted above all else, and then puzzled, as to what I might have done to trigger such a nasty, vicious ostracization. I fear I may never make new friends again, having seen how people can turn on you so sharply and so suddenly.

They are in trouble with the law, and I suspect, I so sincerely hope, that they have been forced to set me up for something in order to lessen what might happen to me, and I understand their actions on that side of things. I do not understand how I went from a friend to a joke overnight. Did they lose that much respect for me, or simply never had any, and were always lying. 

In that latter case I suspect the legal side of things is much bigger that one charge each, and their whole very good pretense at friendship has been a lie for several years now. Being warmly welcomed into their home as a friend, and I really believed I was, was all part of one big betrayal and deception. I cannot believe how two people I judged to be very good - and I am normally a good judge of character - could sustain such a contemptuous deception for so long, and so well.

I find it extremely difficult to accept how part of this vile charade has been interfering with my computer and network equipment, impeding me from finding a desperately needed new job, pushing me to the brink of homelessness. 

This is because when they were homeless I welcomed them into my home as residents and equal housemates at only one day's notice, not as short term guests but as trusted partners without thought of them needing to ever leave. I donated quite some money and did everything I could to make this their home as well as mine.

And Sue has put so much effort into making this a proper home, not a ramshackle bachelor pad, into her home. I have let her take control of nearly all household affairs, and she has, wonderfully. Now I am forced to doubt her pretense of doing it for us all, and a small suspicion is building that at some point it would no longer be my home, that I would be unwelcome.

## Part 2 - The Events and Activities

I feel too many knives in my back to continue with this today, but will expound on how closely they have watched and spied on my every activity in the house.


## Part 3 - A Long Time Friend

Perhaps the worst of this whole affair is that Shaun and I have supposedly been friends for many, many years, yet what I observe in Sue's understanding of my character and maturity, is that of someone physically younger, mentally much younger, and in professional terms, significantly less capable than Shaun. 

Sue and I have known each other for just over two years and until we were housemates, we had not spoken much at all except for light, social chatter. She knew very little about me, and probably thought she knew me more through how Shaun had spoken of me.

Yet I am a few years older than him, and from what I've seen more or less professionally equal. I sometimes fumble in my work, but there is no sign that he is more skilled in his tools than I am in mine. When I mention problems I am having with my work or equipment, he offers the most basic advice, advice I would only give someone several years less experienced and skilled than me. 

I am grateful for his attempts to help, but seeing as we are more or less at the same level professionally, and have never worked together, I can't but wonder why his estimation of my knowledge is so skewed toward me knowing so much less than him. I can't help but assume this again points to his general opinion of me being much lower than his opinion of himself.

One difference between us is that I haven't had many girlfriends or much of a sex life. If these are all that define one's character and standing in life, where the number of people you fuck is the measure of the man you are, and traits like empathy, composure and, especially, courage, are ignored.

This implies an archaic and primitive paradigm . Like when black people and women were thought to be less life skilled than men. It is most contemptuous, disrespectful, and plain rude of him to assume this view of me.

Sue was under the impression that now that we would be working together in the same room, Shaun would be mentoring me, not that we would be helping each other. This suggests that Shaun talks about me as I described above, and very likely views me as such
