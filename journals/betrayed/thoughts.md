They found it a big joke on me, stupid enough to think I would believe all the whispering, mentions of my name, and even fucking laughter, to be hallucinations. Just how fucking stupid do you have to be?

How stupid do you have to be to not be discrete with your whispering, to be overt enough I could follow conversations from the other side of the house. We've have fucking silent electronic comms available everywhere around us for decades. Even a fucking imbecile would have used Whatsapp or Messenger for secret conversations.

But why? We had a good friendship, I thought, at least with Shaun, and Sue is truly such a wonderful, bright, sexy light and genuinely a good person. Who or what cancelled me from the friendship, and since this started, I have more than once asked them "Why", only to have my question ignored.

I am angry, hurt, and insulted above all else, and then puzzled, as to what I might have done to trigger such a nasty, vicious ostracization. I fear I may never make new friends again, having seen how people can turn on you so sharply and so suddenly.

They are in trouble with the law, and I suspect, I so sincerely hope, that they have been forced to set me up for something in order to lessen what might happen to me, and I understand their actions on that side of things. I do not understand how I went from a friend to a joke overnight. Did they lose that much respect for me, or simply never had any, and were always lying. 

In that latter case I suspect the legal side of things is much bigger that one charge each, and their whole very good pretense at friendship has been a lie for several years now. Being warmly welcomed into their home as a friend, and I really believed I was, was all part of one big betrayal and deception. I cannot believe how two people I judged to be very good - and I am normally a good judge of character - could sustain such a contemptuous deception for so long, and so well.
