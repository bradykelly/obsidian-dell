***2024-01-26***: I have no idea why I would go down except a setup, and I'll fight going down with everything in me. If I'm taken off guard, I hope Stephen can help with bail, or maybe Stephen - I've helped him a hell of a lot - and my last resort, the one that will get us evicted, is Nicki.

Whoever may read this, please be sure that I have not gone down for snitching anyone out, ever. Please don't hate me for something I have no damn clue about.

***2024-01-27***: I am an asset, not a mark! A partner, not a liability

So it seems it's Sue that doesn't trust me, because I've had large payments of money. 
# They were just two: a fucking pension payout and an investment that matured, for fucks goddammed sake! And I can prove it! 
# Otherwise I have had no, that means zero, income.

Now it sounds like she suspects me of stealing things! I have been fucking genuine and happy about being friends with this woman, assuming she had accepted me as a friend. For suck's sake! I've loved having her around, and she's just tolerated a nuisance she doesn't trust! Just a fucking walking, breathing wallet is what I've been. Just because I fucking don't pass her strange standards for trustworthiness.

It now also appears she has noticed me listening in on them talking about me. Isn't that quite a natural thing to do? When you hear people whispering about you, not only does the smallest bit of manners give you a right to know what is being said, but caution and curiosity are the biggest reason to try and hear what is being said about you.

What would you do if you heard things being said about you being suspicious, but nobody will confront you about it? When you bring it up, they regurgitate the same, tired old denial. I am hearing things, there is no talking about my trustworthiness. What the living fuck am I supposed to do?

I'm paranoid because I'm being spoken about in secret all the time, not because I'm up to any fucking thing.
