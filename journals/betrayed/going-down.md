***2024-01-26***: I have no idea why I would go down except a setup, and I'll fight going down with everything in me. If I'm taken off guard, I hope Stephen can help with bail, or maybe Stephen - I've helped him a hell of a lot - and my last resort, the one that will get us evicted, is Nicki.

Whoever may read this, please be sure that I have not gone down for snitching anyone out, ever. Please don't hate me for something I have no damn clue about.

***2024-01-27***: I am an asset, not a mark! A partner, not a liability

So it seems it's Sue that doesn't trust me, because I've had large payments of money. 
# They were just two: a fucking pension payout and an investment that matured, for fucks goddammed sake! And I can prove it! 
# Otherwise I have had no, that means zero, income.

Now it sounds like she suspects me of stealing things! I have been fucking genuine and happy about being friends with this woman, assuming she had accepted me as a friend. For suck's sake! I've loved having her around, and she's just tolerated a nuisance she doesn't trust! Just a fucking walking, breathing wallet is what I've been. Just because I fucking don't pass her strange standards for trustworthiness.
