***2024-01-26***: I have no idea why I would go down except a setup, and I'll fight going down with everything in me. If I'm taken off guard, I hope Stephen can help with bail, or maybe Stephen - I've helped him a hell of a lot - and my last resort, the one that will get us evicted, is Nicki.

Whoever may read this, please be sure that I have not gone down for snitching anyone out, ever. Please don't hate me for something I have no damn clue about.

# They were just two: a fucking pension payout and an investment that matured, for fucks goddammed sake! And I can prove it! 
# Otherwise I have had no, that means zero, income.
