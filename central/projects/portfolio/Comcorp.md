I lead and mentored a team of junior developers fresh out of college in the design, implementation, release and maintenance on two products that were groundbreaking for the real estate and home loan industries in South Africa. DealTrak was the first platform in SA that allowed real estate agency franchises to deploy an online system with a central database for tracking and reporting on real estate listings. Previously even large estate agencies were only paper based, or using various small and disparate desktop systems to track listings for single franchisees, with the owning body left without up to date and accurate figures on how outlets were doing. Deployment of DealTrak throughout the business enabled Lew Geffen to qualify for a majority buy in by Sotheby's of the UK, making the business to be know as "Lew Geffen Sotheby's".

The other product called BondTrack was also the first online and centralized system in South Africa that allowed agents for mortgage origination businesses to capture home loan applications once only, often working on site with the realtor making the sale, and have the application submitted to several banks at the same time, and then track the progress of the applications. The originators and buyers to compare the home loan pricing across various banks, as well as judge who best handled the applications. This product was so successful that it's successor, the Mortgage Switch, was targeted for a buy out by several major banks, prompting the Competition Commission to rule against the banks move, stating it would amount to collusion that placed the national mortgage origination industry in the sole hands of the banks.
