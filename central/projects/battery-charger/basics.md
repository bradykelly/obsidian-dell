The maximum charging current for a battery is typically specified in the battery's datasheet or product specifications. It's usually expressed in terms of the battery's capacity (in milliampere-hours, or mAh), known as the C-rating. For example, a battery with a 400mAh capacity has a C-rating of 1.0C, meaning it can safely be charged at a current of 400mA (or 0.4A) [Source 0](https://www.sujorbattery.com/high-drain-battery/e-cigarette-battery-3-7v-13300-400mah.html).

To determine the maximum charging current for your Eve 13300 CS battery cell, you would need to know the battery's capacity. If you don't have this information, you may need to contact the manufacturer or supplier for details.

Once you have the battery's capacity and the C-rating, you can calculate the maximum charging current by multiplying the capacity (in mAh) by the C-rating. For example, if the battery's capacity is 400mAh and the C-rating is 1.0C, the maximum charging current would be 400mA * 1.0C = 400mA (or 0.4A).

Please note that charging a battery at its maximum charging current will result in the fastest possible charging time, but it also increases the risk of overheating and potential damage to the battery. Therefore, it's generally recommended to charge batteries at a lower current for longer periods to prolong their lifespan.
