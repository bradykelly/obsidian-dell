One project was an integration using a data source API of *GoCanvas* in the US and the data input API of *Private Property* in SA. GoCanvas offers a forms application for mobile devices that in this case was configured for realtors to capture listing data for properties.

Private Property use a WCF based API, while GoCanvas used a REST API. My data transfer algorithms for transforming, supplementing, and mapping data in a wide variety of structures were extremely complex.\n\n

Another project was the backend for an online betting system for golfers. The service has evolved a lot since I tested the first transaction on the backend I designed and developed. It is called [PayCaddy](https://www.paycaddy.co.za)

In one key project, I developed an integration service between GoCanvas's REST API in the U.S. and Private Property's WCF-based API in South Africa. Leveraging C#, .NET Framework, WCF, and Windows Services, I engineered complex ETL functions for data transformation. This pioneering system set a precedent for similar integrations in the region.

Another significant undertaking was the backend development for PayCaddy ([https://www.paycaddy.co.za](https://www.paycaddy.co.za/)), an online betting platform for golfers. Utilizing C# and ASP.NET, I created a robust backend infrastructure. The system integrates independent cloud services for card payments and SMS notifications, underlining my ability to incorporate diverse technologies into a cohesive solution.
