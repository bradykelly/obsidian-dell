In one key project, I developed an integration service between GoCanvas's REST API in the U.S. and Private Property's WCF-based API in South Africa. Leveraging C#, .NET Framework, WCF, and Windows Services, I engineered complex ETL functions for data transformation. This pioneering system set a precedent for similar integrations in the region.

Another significant undertaking was the backend development for PayCaddy ([https://www.paycaddy.co.za](https://www.paycaddy.co.za/)), an online betting platform for golfers. Utilizing C# and ASP.NET, I created a robust backend infrastructure. The system integrates independent cloud services for card payments and SMS notifications, underlining my ability to incorporate diverse technologies into a cohesive solution.
