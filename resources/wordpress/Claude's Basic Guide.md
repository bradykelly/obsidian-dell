## Code

Sure, I can provide you with a tutorial on how to build a custom WordPress website using the Block system while working directly with PHP and JavaScript files, rather than relying on the built-in Site Editor. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Setting Up a Local Development Environment**
Before you start building your custom website, you'll need to set up a local development environment. This will allow you to work on your website files without affecting your live site. You can use tools like XAMPP, MAMP, or Local by Flywheel to create a local server environment.

2. **Understanding the WordPress Directory Structure**
WordPress follows a specific directory structure, and it's essential to understand it before you start customizing your website. The main directories you'll be working with are:

- `wp-content/themes/` - This is where you'll create or install your custom theme files.
- `wp-content/plugins/` - This is where you'll install or create custom plugins.
- `wp-includes/` - This directory contains the core WordPress files, which you should never modify directly.

3. **Creating a Custom Theme**
To build your custom website, you'll need to create a custom theme. Inside the `wp-content/themes/` directory, create a new folder for your theme. Within this folder, you'll need to create at least two files: `style.css` and `index.php`. The `style.css` file will contain your theme's styles, while the `index.php` file will be the main template file for your theme.

4. **Registering Block Patterns**
WordPress introduced Block Patterns in version 5.5, allowing you to create reusable blocks with predefined layouts and styles. To register your custom Block Patterns, you'll need to create a new folder within your theme directory, typically named `patterns/`. Inside this folder, create a PHP file (e.g., `patterns.php`) and use the `register_block_pattern()` function to define your patterns.

5. **Creating Custom Blocks**
To create custom blocks, you'll need to work with JavaScript and PHP files. Inside your theme directory, create a new folder called `blocks/`. Within this folder, create a subfolder for each custom block you want to create. Each subfolder should contain at least two files: `block.json` (or `block.js` if you prefer) and a PHP file (e.g., `render-block.php`).

The `block.json` (or `block.js`) file will define the block's settings, such as its name, category, attributes, and fields. The PHP file (`render-block.php`) will handle the rendering of the block on the front-end.

6. **Enqueuing Scripts and Styles**
To ensure that your custom blocks and Block Patterns work correctly, you'll need to enqueue the necessary scripts and styles. You can do this by adding the appropriate functions to your theme's `functions.php` file, using the `wp_enqueue_script()` and `wp_enqueue_style()` functions.

7. **Building Templates and Pages**
With your custom blocks and Block Patterns set up, you can start building your website's templates and pages. Within your theme directory, create a new folder called `templates/` (or `page-templates/`). Here, you'll create PHP files for different page templates, such as the front page, blog posts, and custom post types.

Inside these template files, you can use the `get_template_part()` function to include your custom blocks and patterns, as well as other WordPress template tags and functions.

8. **Customizing WordPress Templates**
WordPress provides several template files that control different aspects of your website, such as `header.php`, `footer.php`, `single.php`, `archive.php`, and more. You can customize these files to match your website's design and functionality requirements.

9. **Testing and Debugging**
As you work on your custom website, it's essential to test and debug your code regularly. WordPress provides several debugging tools, such as the built-in Debug Bar plugin and the `WP_DEBUG` constant in the `wp-config.php` file. You can also use browser developer tools to inspect and debug your JavaScript code.

10. **Deployment and Maintenance**
Once you've completed building your custom website, you'll need to deploy it to a live server. This process typically involves transferring your theme files, plugins, and database to the live server. After deployment, you'll need to maintain your website by updating WordPress, plugins, and your custom code as necessary.

This tutorial covers the essential steps for building a custom WordPress website using the Block system while working directly with PHP and JavaScript files. Keep in mind that building a custom WordPress website can be a complex process, and you may need to consult additional resources or seek help from the WordPress community as you encounter specific challenges or requirements.

## Tools

When working with JetBrains PHPStorm and developing custom WordPress themes, you have a few options for tools to help you with layout and design, including some with graphical interfaces:

1. **WordPress Theme Development Tools**
   - **Pinegrow Web Editor**: Pinegrow is a third-party tool that integrates with PHPStorm and provides a visual interface for designing WordPress themes. It allows you to work with WordPress templates and blocks using a drag-and-drop interface and live previews.
   - **Atom IDE**: Atom is a free and open-source text editor that can be integrated with PHPStorm. You can install packages like `atom-wordpress` to get WordPress-specific features and tools for theme development.

2. **Front-end Web Development Tools**
   - **PHPStorm's Built-in Tools**: PHPStorm has several built-in tools that can help with layout and design, such as the integrated Live Edit feature, which allows you to preview your code changes in real-time in a browser window.
   - **Browser Developer Tools**: Modern web browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox have powerful built-in developer tools that can aid in front-end design and development. These tools allow you to inspect, modify, and debug your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code directly in the browser.

3. **Design Tools**
   - **Adobe XD**: Adobe XD is a popular design tool that can be used for creating wireframes, prototypes, and user interface designs. While not directly integrated with PHPStorm, you can use XD to design your WordPress theme's layouts and then translate them into code.
   - **Figma**: Figma is a collaborative web-based design tool that allows you to create designs, prototypes, and wireframes. Like Adobe XD, you can use Figma to design your WordPress theme's layouts and then code them manually.

4. **Prototyping and Wireframing Tools**
   - **InVision**: InVision is a popular prototyping and wireframing tool that can be used to create interactive designs and prototypes for your WordPress themes. While not directly integrated with PHPStorm, you can use InVision to design and prototype your theme's layouts before coding them.

When choosing the right tools for layout and design, consider factors such as your team's workflow, the complexity of your project, and your familiarity with the tools. Many developers find that a combination of these tools works best, using design tools for initial layouts and wireframes, and then transitioning to code-based tools like PHPStorm's Live Edit or browser developer tools for fine-tuning and implementation.

## Dorik

Dorik is a relatively new tool that can be useful for building custom WordPress themes and websites with a visual, drag-and-drop interface. Here's an overview of how Dorik can be integrated with your WordPress development workflow using PHPStorm:

1. **Install the Dorik Plugin for WordPress**: First, you'll need to install the Dorik plugin on your WordPress site. This plugin allows you to connect your WordPress site with the Dorik app.

2. **Open Dorik App**: Once the plugin is installed, you can open the Dorik app from your WordPress admin area. The Dorik app is a cloud-based visual editor that allows you to design your website's pages and templates using a drag-and-drop interface.

3. **Design with Dorik**: In the Dorik app, you can create new pages, templates, and blocks using a wide range of pre-built components and design elements. You can customize the layout, styling, and functionality of your website using Dorik's visual interface.

4. **Export to PHPStorm**: After designing your website in Dorik, you can export the code for your custom theme or templates. Dorik generates clean and well-structured HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that you can then import into your PHPStorm project.

5. **Integrate with WordPress**: In PHPStorm, you can continue working on the exported code, integrating it with your WordPress theme's PHP files, adding custom functionality, and making any necessary adjustments or customizations.

6. **Sync Changes with Dorik**: Dorik allows you to sync changes made to the code in PHPStorm back to the Dorik app. This way, you can continue to use the visual editor in Dorik while still benefiting from the power and flexibility of coding in PHPStorm.

The integration between Dorik and PHPStorm can be particularly useful if you prefer to work with a visual editor for designing layouts and UI elements, but still want to have full control over the code and the ability to add custom functionality using PHP, JavaScript, and other technologies.

It's worth noting that Dorik is a relatively new tool, and its integration with WordPress and other development environments may continue to evolve. However, for those who prefer a visual approach to web design combined with the power of coding, Dorik can be a valuable addition to your WordPress development workflow alongside tools like PHPStorm.
