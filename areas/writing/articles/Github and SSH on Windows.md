1. Optional features install for server seems to hang.
2. Found this [SO question](https://superuser.com/questions/1688019/cant-install-open-ssh-server-in-windows-10), OP solved problem following [this blog](https://www.saotn.org/install-openssh-in-windows-server/)
3. Download .msi from [Github](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH)

	2. Went with **v9.5.0.0p1-Beta**
	3. [OpenSSH-Win64-v9.5.0.0.msi](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases/download/v9.5.0.0p1-Beta/OpenSSH-Win64-v9.5.0.0.msi)
	4. YMMV!
