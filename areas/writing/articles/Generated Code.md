Very often a code component will appear well tested and documented, especially for busy coders that don't have time to read a README file for no reason, or to run tests on code not related to their projects. However, sometimes a closer look at the code base reveals code that should have received more attention than it did.

Often developers will accept defaults, borrow a code snippet, or generate some tests, just to get back to really important work without delay. There is a crossover point though, where these hastily conjured pieces of code cease to contribute to code quality and become liabilities. Tests that only have coverage but no depth, documentation that is either fully outdated, or never even properly developed, and methods that only say, "Hello world".
