- Ideal for niche markets with expensive tooling, e.g. medical equipment 
- Capture the need for a market of high quality, not very old, equipment 
- Large chains of used good stores have made the market for older, cheaper used goods to settle into a low price, low quality, and readily available used goods that are commonplace and general purpose.
- Someone like a student that can't afford new tooling is currently at a loss for less expensive but still high quality goods. 
- Second hand and pawn shops do not carry expensive goods as a rule. Their customer base is largely bargain hunters, thus they cannot accept higher priced purchases, as they battle to quickly resell these and recoup their cash.
- These shops are known for paying sellers very low amounts for low to medium priced goods they are prepared to make a substantial loss on.

- Enter the specialist equipment vendor who for example is currently only an outlet for push based marketing, where goods suppliers have significant if not total influence over which brands a vendor deals in.
- The AI/ML wave will result in mass produced goods requiring a significantly smaller human workforce, and at the same time becoming cheaper. Mainstream outlets are already geared towards massive streams of medium quality, very readily available goods.
- Opportunistic sales houses for an ever decreasing flow of specialist, high quality goods can increase their sales volumes by diversifying into buying and selling of newish, high quality specialist equipment.
- Partner with manufacturers and suppliers for refurbished and certified used goods.
