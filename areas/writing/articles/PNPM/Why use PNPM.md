PNPM stands for Performant NPM, a more advanced solution with much better performance than the well known and widely used Node Package Manager (NPM). It is an open-sourced and MIT licensed package manager for Node, and, ironically, installed using NPM.

As an example, running `npm install` for the popular Tailwind CSS styling  framework took **82 seconds** and resulted in a `node_modules` folder containing 37,215 files taking up **1.3GB** disk space. This is just in one project, so you can imagine how much disk space is taken up by Node packages across several large projects on an engineer's workstation.
