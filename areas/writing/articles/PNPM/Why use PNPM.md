PNPM stands for Performant NPM, a more advanced solution with much better performance than the well known and widely used Node Package Manager (NPM). It is an open-sourced and MIT licensed package manager for Node, and, ironically, installed using NPM.

PNPM offers huge improvements in, mainly, installation time and disk space usage, and can perform a package installation for a full project sometimes up to ten times faster than NPM.
