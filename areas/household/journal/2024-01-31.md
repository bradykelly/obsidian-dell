11:17:  Woke up with a bad case of valium withdrawal, will take some Seroquel after lunch to calm my nerves and get some work done. Housemates still seem secretive, but maybe just being private. I wish I could be sure they are not angry at me or planning something. 

If they are, I have no idea what to do. I wish they could offer me some sort of out, ask me to explain myself for whatever it is I have done. I have hinted several times that I can help with whatever problem they seem to have.
