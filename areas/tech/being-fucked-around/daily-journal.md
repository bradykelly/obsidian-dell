# Daily Journal of Being Fucked Around

I have had so, so many problems with my brand new, not yet customized, Dell 5620 Laptop and Windows 11, as well as my two Lenovo laptops, I feel as if someone is watching me try to work on them and having a good fucking laugh fucking me around. 

Most problems seem to be network related, downloads that fail, apps that don't connect, very slow network etc. We are on the same wifi network, no matter how they get on, but I am better at fault finding than they are at fault injecting and I will root out the menace.

If I had started journaling earlier I would have had many hundreds of entries already across three machine and three operating systems. Make the four of each because I think this wannabe whatever-colour-hat is perhaps messing with my phone as well.
